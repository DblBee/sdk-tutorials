# Types

The main struct of our module will be the `Greeting`. We will use this when
creating/updating and retrieving the "greetings" sent to our fullnode. Let's
define this struct and other necessary components fot a types package in a types file inside the `x/greeter/types` directory

Save this to `x/greeter//types/types.go`

<<< @/hellochain/x/greeter/types/types.go
